✅ What the Program Does:
User Input Selection:

Asks the user to choose between two options:

'returns' – Calculate future wealth over a set number of years.

'freedom' – Determine how many years it will take to reach financial freedom.

Data Collection:

Prompts the user to enter:

Current Wealth – Initial amount of money you have.

Rate of Return (%) – Annual percentage return on investments.

Monthly Savings – Amount saved every month.

If the user selects 'freedom', it also asks for Target Wealth – the amount needed to be financially free.

Option 1: 'returns' – Wealth Calculation Over Time:

Simulates the growth of total wealth for a specified number of years.

Each year, it adds:

Interest (based on the rate of return).

Annual savings (monthly savings × 12).

Prints the total wealth at the end of each year.

Option 2: 'freedom' – Years Until Financial Freedom:

Repeats the calculation annually until total savings exceed the target wealth.

Displays how many years it will take to reach the target and prints a motivational message.

Error Handling:

If the user enters invalid input (e.g., non-numeric values), the program displays an error message and exits.

Program Flow:

Continues running calculations until it meets the conditions or the user provides incorrect input.
